# Stance Detection from Text

## Problem statement

Introduction of social media platforms has allowed people to express their opinions freely on variety of topics. Some topics tend to be controversial and garners a spectrum of opinions.
Understanding the stance of people on these topics and messages becomes crucial to understand the general opinion of public which can be used for further studies and analysis.
Our project aims at implementing a platform that allows for the detection of stance from text. â€‹
To implement this, we will be using stance detection models which take the input, preprocess it in the format suitable, extract the relevant features and deliver the predictions.
Furthermore, we will be comparing the results of different models to find the best performing one. Along with that, we will be providing a user interface so that users can interact with the trained models for detection of stance.
